User: ‚ÄúTell me about Bukowski‚Äôs writing style.‚Äù
System: ‚ÄúBukowski‚Äôs writing style is often described as raw, minimalistic, and unpretentious. He favored free verse in his poetry and used a conversational tone in his prose, focusing on the grittier aspects of everyday life‚Äîlove, work, poverty, and the human condition.‚Äù

User: ‚ÄúWhat was Bukowski‚Äôs life like?‚Äù
System: ‚ÄúBorn in Andernach, Germany, in 1920, Bukowski emigrated to the U.S. as a child and grew up in Los Angeles.
